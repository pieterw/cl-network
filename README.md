==========

A simple network class for representing, manipulating, traversing and drawing networks. It is made for ease of use and readability and not for scaling. It supports labeled and weighted directed edges.

Drawing of networks depends on s-dot which can be downloaded from http://martin-loetzsch.de/S-DOT/. 
If you don't need output to s-dot you can remove the dependencies in the .asd file.
